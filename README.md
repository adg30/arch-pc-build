## 4. Technical & Compatibility Justification

* **CPU (Intel Core i9-14900K):** The i9-14900K was chosen as it is Intel's flagship consumer processor, offering the highest single-core clock speeds essential for maximum FPS in gaming. Its 24 cores and 32 threads also provide massive multi-core performance for streaming or content creation, fitting the "extreme" build requirement.

* **Motherboard (MSI MAG Z790 Tomahawk):** This Z790 motherboard offers strong power delivery (VRMs) necessary to handle the high power draw of the i9-14900K. It features the required LGA 1700 socket, DDR5 RAM support, and a PCIe 5.0 x16 slot to provide maximum bandwidth for a top-tier graphics card.

* **CPU Cooler (Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360):** The i9-14900K is known to produce significant heat. As such, 360mm AIO liquid cooler is required for effective thermal management, preventing performance throttling and allowing the CPU to maintain its high boost clocks.

* **RAM (Corsair Dominator Titanium 64GB DDR5):** A 64GB kit of high-speed DDR5 RAM was selected for ultimate future-proofing and extreme multitasking. 6000MT/s with a CL30 latency hits the "sweet spot" for performance on the Intel platform, ensuring fast data access for the CPU.

* **GPU (GEFORCE RTX 5080 ASUS PRIME OC):** The RTX 5080 is the centerpiece of this "extreme gaming" build, chosen for no-compromise 4K performance. Powered by the Blackwell architecture, its 16GB of GDDR7 memory provides the bandwidth for maximum settings in AAA titles. Crucially, the ASUS PRIME OC model was selected for its 304mm length, ensuring a perfect fit within the spacious Meshify 2 case. Normally we would've gone for the more powerful and expensive 5090, however all Manila-based vendors for it are out of stock.

* **Storage 1 (WD BLACK SN850X 4TB):** A high-capacity 4TB NVMe SSD was chosen as the primary drive for ultra-fast boot times and game loading, taking full advantage of the Z790 motherboard's PCIe Gen4 M.2 slots.

* **Storage 2 (TeamGroup Vulcan Z 2TB):** A 2TB SATA SSD provides a cost-effective solution for mass storage, housing a large library of games or media files without occupying a primary M.2 slot.

* **Power Supply (Corsair RM1200x SHIFT 1200W):** A 1200W Gold-rated PSU was selected to safely and efficiently power the high-wattage i9-14900K and RTX 5080. This provides ample headroom for peak power spikes and ensures system stability, which a lower-wattage unit could not guarantee.

* **Case (Fractal Design Meshify 2):** The Meshify 2 was strategically selected to prioritize superior airflow and spacious component compatibility. A critical factor was its massive 467mm GPU clearance, which easily accommodates our RTX 5080 and ensures excellent airflow around the system's most powerful components.

* **Case Fans (Lian Li Uni):** The Lian Li Uni Fan pack was selected to elevate the system's cooling and aesthetics beyond the stock configuration. These premium fans will be configured to maximize directed airflow across all critical components. Aesthetically, their unique daisy-chain system reduces cable clutter and the included controller synchronizes the RGB lighting, creating a clean, visually cohesive look that is appropriate for a premium, "extreme-tier" build.

## 5. Budget Analysis

* **Budget Limit**: ₱200,000.00
* **Final Total**: ₱205,555.00
* **Result**: Within Budget ✅
* **Notes**: The final cost is ₱5,555 over the base budget. This is compliant with the project requirement for our group, which allows for an overage of up to 5% (₱10,000). This slight overage was deemed a necessary trade-off to ensure the system's stability and longevity by selecting a high-wattage 1200W power supply and a spacious, high-airflow case, rather than compromising on the safety and cooling of the extreme-performance components.

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings

This project provided significant insight into the challenges of building a PC in the Philippines. We learned that component selection is a balance between performance, compatibility, and budget, with local pricing and availability being major factors.

Our key learning was the critical importance of checking detailed physical specifications. We initially faced compatibility issues, first with a motherboard form factor mismatch and then with GPU length vs. case clearance. Solving these problems by upgrading to the Fractal Design Meshify 2 taught us that a well-chosen case is not only about aesthetics, but is a fundamental part of a successful and stress-free build. This process of identifying and correcting errors reinforced our understanding of computer architecture in a practical, hands-on manner.
