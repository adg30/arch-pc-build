## 1. Introduction

This project aims to produce an **Intel-based Extreme-entry level gaming desktop computer** with a budget of **₱200,000**. The build is primarily intended for high-performance gaming, providing the ability to run contemporary titles effectively, while also meeting general-purpose computing requirements such as academic activities, productivity, and multimedia applications.

Each component was carefully chosen to meet the budget constraints while ensuring compatibility, performance, and dependability. The goal of this construct is to show a well-balanced system that meets the project's criteria and illustrates the appropriate use of computer architecture concepts in a real setting.

## 4. Compatibility Justification

For each part, explain compatibility and choices.
Example:

- **CPU + Motherboard**: Intel i5-13400F (LGA1700) works with ASUS B760M board
  (LGA1700 socket, BIOS compatible).
- **RAM**: DDR5 RAM supported by motherboard slots (up to 128GB).
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 3060 fits case, PSU wattage sufficient.

## 5. Budget Analysis

- **Budget Limit**: ₱XX,000
- **Final Total**: ₱XX,000
- Within budget / Over budget✅ ❌
- Notes on trade-offs (e.g., cheaper RAM, higher PSU wattage, no aftermarket
  cooler, etc.).
