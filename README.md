## 4. Technical & Compatibility Justification

* **CPU (Intel Core i9-14900K):** Chosen for its class-leading single-core speeds, which maximize FPS in modern games. With 24 cores and 32 threads, it also handles heavy multitasking such as streaming and rendering. This ensures the CPU won’t bottleneck future GPUs, making it both powerful now and reliable for the next several years.
  
* **Motherboard (MSI MAG Z790 Tomahawk):** Selected for its strong VRM power delivery, essential for the i9-14900K’s high power draw. It supports DDR5 memory, PCIe 5.0 GPUs and SSDs, and WiFi 6E, providing both stability today and upgrade paths for upcoming hardware generations.

* **CPU Cooler (Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360):** A 360mm AIO liquid cooler is necessary to keep the i9-14900K’s high thermals under control. This prevents thermal throttling, maintains boost clock speeds, and ensures quieter, more stable long-term operation.

* **RAM (Corsair Dominator Titanium 64GB DDR5):** Offers both high frequency and low latency, optimizing performance on Intel’s platform. The 64GB capacity far exceeds current gaming requirements but provides future-proofing for large games, content creation, and multitasking workloads.

* **GPU (GEFORCE RTX 5080 ASUS PRIME OC):** The centerpiece of the build, the RTX 5080 delivers uncompromising 4K gaming performance, backed by NVIDIA’s latest Blackwell architecture and 16GB of fast GDDR7 VRAM. We chose the 5080 over the 5090 because while the latter offers higher performance, it costs nearly double, giving diminishing returns for our “extreme entry-level” scope. 

* **Storage 1 (WD BLACK SN850X 4TB):** A top-tier Gen4 NVMe SSD with blazing 7300MB/s speeds, ensuring ultra-fast boot, game loads, and file transfers. Its 4TB capacity supports large modern game libraries and future storage demands without compromise.

* **Storage 2 (TeamGroup Vulcan Z 2TB):** Provides cost-effective secondary storage for games and media. While slower than NVMe, it’s still far faster than HDDs and avoids consuming valuable M.2 slots.

* **Power Supply (Corsair RM1200x SHIFT 1200W):** Provides stable, efficient power delivery with ATX 3.0 and PCIe 5.0 readiness. Its 1200W capacity ensures stability even under peak GPU/CPU spikes and leaves headroom for future upgrades, making it safer than lower-wattage alternatives.

* **Case (Fractal Design Meshify 2):** Offers exceptional airflow and internal space, which is critical for cooling extreme-performance components. With a 467mm GPU clearance and support for a 360mm radiator, it comfortably fits the RTX 5080 and AIO cooler while leaving room for expansion.

* **Case Fans (Lian Li Uni):** Improve airflow beyond stock fans, keeping components cooler and quieter under load. Their daisy-chain design reduces cable clutter, and the included controller syncs RGB lighting for a cleaner, more premium look consistent with the extreme-tier build.

## 5. Budget Analysis

* **Budget Limit**: ₱200,000.00
* **Final Total**: ₱205,555.00
* **Result**: Within Budget ✅
* **Notes**: The final cost is ₱5,555 over the base budget. This is compliant with the project requirement for our group, which allows for an overage of up to 5% (₱10,000). This slight overage was deemed a necessary trade-off to ensure the system's stability and longevity by selecting a high-wattage 1200W power supply and a spacious, high-airflow case, rather than compromising on the safety and cooling of the extreme-performance components.

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings

This project provided significant insight into the challenges of building a PC in the Philippines. We learned that component selection is a balance between performance, compatibility, and budget, with local pricing and availability being major factors.

Our key learning was the critical importance of checking detailed physical specifications. We initially faced compatibility issues, first with a motherboard form factor mismatch and then with GPU length vs. case clearance. Solving these problems by upgrading to the Fractal Design Meshify 2 taught us that a well-chosen case is not only about aesthetics, but is a fundamental part of a successful and stress-free build. This process of identifying and correcting errors reinforced our understanding of computer architecture in a practical, hands-on manner.
